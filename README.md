# FinancialDataWallet
My first work with Django
This site aim to help people who want to check any action's companies etc of Euronext every day.
This project was made in Django. I used BeautifulSoup and requests for library. 

The user have to enter ISIN and MIC Code, this is the data I need to requests on euronext and take all the informations I need. If the data is correct, beautifulSoup help me to webscrap and save the data into NoSQL.
